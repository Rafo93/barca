                <p>On 22 October 1899, Joan Gamper placed an advertisement in
                    Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive
                    response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November.
                    Eleven players attended: Walter Wild (the first director of the club),
                    Lluís d'Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal,
                    Pere Cabot, Josep Llobet, John Parsons and William Parsons. As a result,
                    Football Club Barcelona was born.[1] The blue and red colours of the shirt
                    were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900; the prevailing Catalonia
                    conception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel.
                    FC Barcelona quickly emerged as one of the leading clubs in Spain, competing in the Campeonato de Cataluña
                    and the Copa del Rey. In 1902, the club won its first trophy, the Copa Macaya, and also played in the first Copa del Rey
                    final, losing 2–1 to Bizcaya.
                    <br/>
                    In 1908, Joan Gamper became club president for the first time to save the club from bankruptcy.
                    The club had not won since the Campeonato de Cataluña in 1905; this caused their financial trouble.
                    One of his main achievements was to help Barcelona acquire its own stadium and thus achieve a stable income.
                    <br/>
                    On 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Indústria, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000.
                    To celebrate their new surroundings, a logo contest was held the following year. Carles Comamala won the contest,
                    and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears as of 2012, with some minor changes.
                    <br/>
                    With the new stadium, Barcelona participated in the inaugural version of the Pyrenees Cup, which, at the time,
                    consisted of the best teams of Languedoc, MIDI and Aquitaine (Southern France), the Basque Country and Catalonia;
                    all were former members of the Marca Hispanica region. The contest was generally considered the most prestigious in
                    that era. From the inaugural year in 1910 to 1913, Barcelona won the competition four consecutive times. Carles Comamala
                    played an integral part of the four-time champion, managing the side along with Amechazurra and Jack Greenwell. The latter
                    became the club's first full-time coach in 1917. The last edition was held in 1914 in the city of Barcelona, which local
                    rivals Espanyol won.
                    <br/>
                    Gamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club-members, and, by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new Les Cortes, which they inaugurated the same year. Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 22,000, and was later[when?] expanded to 60,000.
                    <br/>
                    During the same period, the club changed its official language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity. On 4 February 1917, the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ramón Torralba who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa, which Barcelona won 6–2.
                    <br/>
                    Gamper recruited Jack Greenwell as the first full-time manager in Barcelona's history. After he was hired, the club's fortunes began to improve on the field. During the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campeonato de Cataluña, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups and enjoyed its first "golden age".
